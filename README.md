### Design

#### Typography
All fonts used are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

Fonts used include:
* 
* 

#### Colour Scheme


#### Imagery
* The hero image on each page was designed to take up 70% of the full-screen height. In doing so, a hint of the following content is given. 


#### Design justifications
A consistent layout was used throughout the pages. Sections were reused throughout pages as needed to both decrease the amount of new code needed and improve the familiarity of content. 

To improve the user experience, the use of the ```<a href = "" target = "_blank"> </a>``` was limited, applying the ```target = "_blank">``` attribute only for external links, such as social links and mailto.
